# Requirements: AVD Health Monitor Refactor

**Defined:** 2026-01-16
**Core Value:** Reliable, unobtrusive AVD endpoint monitoring that helps IT admins identify connectivity issues before users experience problems.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for this refactor cycle.

### Installer

- [x] **INST-01**: Application installs without admin privileges (per-user install to AppData)
- [x] **INST-02**: WiX MSI compilation succeeds without errors
- [x] **INST-03**: NSIS installer builds successfully
- [x] **INST-04**: Installer provides option for system-wide or per-user install

### Tech Debt - Components

- [x] **COMP-01**: SettingsPanel.tsx split into ModeSelector component
- [x] **COMP-02**: SettingsPanel.tsx split into ThresholdSettings component
- [x] **COMP-03**: SettingsPanel.tsx split into CustomEndpointManager component
- [x] **COMP-04**: SettingsPanel.tsx split into ModeEndpointList component
- [x] **COMP-05**: SettingsPanel.tsx split into FSLogixSettings component
- [x] **COMP-06**: SettingsPanel.tsx under 300 lines after refactor

### Tech Debt - State

- [x] **STATE-01**: useAppStore split into configSlice
- [x] **STATE-02**: useAppStore split into endpointSlice
- [x] **STATE-03**: useAppStore split into fslogixSlice
- [x] **STATE-04**: useAppStore split into uiSlice
- [x] **STATE-05**: Persistence logic isolated in dedicated module

### Tech Debt - Race Conditions

- [x] **RACE-01**: Mode switch uses proper state sequencing (no setTimeout)
- [x] **RACE-02**: App.tsx test triggers use Zustand subscribe pattern
- [x] **RACE-03**: Endpoint loading completes before tests trigger

### Tech Debt - Types

- [x] **TYPE-01**: LatencyThresholds type unified between Rust and TypeScript
- [x] **TYPE-02**: AppConfig type unified between Rust and TypeScript
- [x] **TYPE-03**: Type generation from Rust to TypeScript (ts-rs or similar)

### Security

- [x] **SEC-01**: Settings JSON validated against schema on load
- [x] **SEC-02**: Portable mode uses OS API for permission check (no test file)
- [x] **SEC-03**: File paths validated before external editor invocation

### Testing

- [x] **TEST-01**: Integration tests for settings save/load roundtrip
- [x] **TEST-02**: Integration tests for mode switching flow
- [x] **TEST-03**: Unit tests for Zustand store slices
- [x] **TEST-04**: FSLogix path parsing tests
- [x] **TEST-05**: Tray icon state tests (where testable)

### Features

- [x] **FEAT-01**: User can export settings to JSON file
- [x] **FEAT-02**: User can import settings from JSON file
- [x] **FEAT-03**: User can export latency history to CSV
- [x] **FEAT-04**: App shows meaningful state when offline (graceful degradation)

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release.

### Enhanced Testing

- **TEST-V2-01**: E2E tests with Tauri test driver
- **TEST-V2-02**: Visual regression tests for UI components
- **TEST-V2-03**: Performance benchmarks for latency testing

### Enhanced Features

- **FEAT-V2-01**: Scheduled reports via email
- **FEAT-V2-02**: Multi-endpoint batch import
- **FEAT-V2-03**: Endpoint groups/tags for organization
